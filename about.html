    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="prompt">Hello! I'm Nikita, a human, math and coding enthusiast and something of a dreamer.</p>

    <p>I have a strong interest in math, physics, coding, algorithms and systems, hardware. I want to understand everything from the first principles. I care about truth. I try to do stuff. </p>

    <h2 class="prompt">Background</h2>
    <p>I graduated with a degree in math from Cambridge University. During my studies, I focused on algebra and differential geometry, I however had a good grasp on modern analysis as well. I am also a competitive programming enthusiast. After my first year at universtity I knew some machine learning but i had no idea how does the underlying hardware work, which resulted in infinitely large napkin: notes i have taken while trying to understand everything inside the computer from transistors to web browsers and inbetween. I am still learning, still feel like a noob. Before university I did competitive math and also played chess. Both are big parts of my identity still. I also had a thing with rationality and EA communities untill the pause in AI development were supported by both. I like George Hotz, Kenye West, Martin Shkreli and California. Now I am a quant based in London. </p>
    <p>I am also a fan of contrarian ideas which are not obviously wrong. If you have any, please  <a href="mailto:nikitak.khomich.work@gmail.com">email me</a> Those will be added to contrarian takes section with intellectual writes preserved.</p>
